## About Me

Hello, I'm Peter. I am a software engineer and co-creator of Dendro, an open-source monitoring framework built with AWS and designed for small distributed systems. 
<br>

## Projects  

#### Dendro

Dendro is an open-source, serverless monitoring framework for small, distributed apps. As part of a team of 4, I built Dendro in order to help small teams handle the challenges of operating a distributed system.
