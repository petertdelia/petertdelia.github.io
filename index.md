## About Me

Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pete! I am an enthusiastically product-minded software engineer with years of experience in production systems for high-growth SaaS startups. I love working as part of high-achieving teams focused on building world-class products. I also built Dendro (getdendro.com), an open source observability framework built using AWS services, and intended to be used by small, distributed applications. My non-traditional background includes a Ph.D. in music history and a career as a concertizing classical pianist and teacher. Take a look below ðŸ‘‡ to see what Iâ€™ve been working on recently!

<br>

Dendro [(getdendro.com)](https://getdendro.com) is an open-source, serverless monitoring framework for small, distributed apps. Along with a remote team spread throughout the United States, I built Dendro to help small teams handle the challenges of operating a distributed system.

Dendro collects and centralizes logs and metrics from various sources, enabling developers maintaining distributed systems to gain increased visibility into their system. This allows them to detect and fix problems earlier than they would if they had no monitoring solution.

Dendro is installed via npm, and provides a command line interface that enables users to configure and build a monitoring pipeline with just two commands. It is completely serverless and uses a time-series database to store logs and metrics, making querying by time fast and powerful.
