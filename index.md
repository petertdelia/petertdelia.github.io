## About Me

Hi. I'm Antoine Leclercq.

I am a professional software developer committed to producing value-added work by continuously improving my knowledge of software product development and the practice of its science.

Amongst my professional experiences, I have led critical technical projects, I have enabled cross-team communication at a 100+ developers organization, I have built an Open Source project, and I have given technical talks meetups and a conference.

My approach to software is steeped in the essence of Agile and its principles. My goal is to write maintainable and flexible software. I believe that, as a professional software developer, it's my responsibility to produce value-added work, avoid making rework-inducing  mistakes (architectural mistakes, design mistakes, development mistakes, etc.). That is why I strive to continuously improve my knowledge and practice of software design, system design, and software product development processes.
