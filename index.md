## About Me

Hello, I'm Peter. I am a software engineer and co-creator of Dendro, an open-source monitoring framework built with AWS and designed for small distributed systems. 

I recently built Dendro, an open-source, serverless monitoring framework for small, distributed apps, in order to help small teams handle the challenges of operating a distributed system.

Dendro is an open-source, serverless monitoring framework for small, distributed apps. Along with a remote team spread throughout the United States, I built Dendro to help small teams handle the challenges of operating a distributed system.

Dendro collects and centralizes logs and metrics from various sources, enabling developers maintaining distributed systems to gain increased visibility into their system. This allows them to detect and fix problems earlier than they would if they had no monitoring solution.

Dendro is installed via npm, and provides a command line interface that enables users to configure and build a monitoring pipeline with just two commands. It is completely serverless and uses a time-series database to store logs and metrics, making querying by time fast and powerful.

To listen to me demoing installing and using Dendro during a presentation of the project, click play below.
