## About Me

Hello, I'm Peter. I am a software engineer and co-creator of Dendro, an open-source monitoring framework built with AWS and designed for small distributed systems. 

I recently built Dendro, an open-source, serverless monitoring framework for small, distributed apps, in order to help small teams handle the challenges of operating a distributed system.
